    <notes>nature of the tenant/landlord relationship in the social rented sector is very important ways to maximise benefits of housing renewal for tenants ... offer choice of contractor from an approved list ... encourage direct relationship with those carrying out the work ... involve tenants in the details of the renewal ... consider whether or not the work has to be carried out during the tenancy or why it must be done at a particular time ... especially important for elderly residents</notes>
    <process_used>people who were able to establish control over what was happening had a more positive experience also depended on how much control the individual wanted and, crucially, its negotiability opportunity to effect a change in one aspect of life, such as the home environment means that it can be seen as possible in another through raised self-esteem and confidence</process_used>

    <conclusion>The study indicates that social circumstances have pervasive health consequences social factors can influence host resistance and affect vulnerability to disease The study showed that: the absence of any form of social contact led to a significant increase in risk of death during the follow-up period social and community ties protected against a variety of diseases but the mechanism by which social networks influence health status remains unclear 3 possible pathways by which social isolation leads to ill health: influence the use of preventive health practices influence an individual's psycho-social response to social isolation which may pre-dispose that individual to suicide or risk taking behaviour leads to physiological changes in the body which affects the individual's susceptibility to infection</conclusion>

    <key_issues_rel_he>Mortality rates were lower in respondents who were: married, had frequent contacts with friends and relatives, members of a church, and other social/community organisations The Social Network Index revealed a consistent pattern of increasing mortality rates associated with each decrease in social connections. Association between social network index and mortality found to be independent of: self reported physical health status, year of death socio-economic status health behaviours and status eg ... smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, obesity, low utilisation of preventative health services and a cumulative index of health practices</key_issues_rel_he>
    <measure_social_cap>4 sources of social contacts looked at marital status contact with close friends and relatives church membership informal and formal group membership A Social Network Index was created to summarise the effect of increasing social isolation on mortality.

    <conclusion>Mechanism linking social capital to health might be different to those that link social network to individual health. There is an important need to distinguish between the contextual effects of living in an area depleted with social capital and any compositional effects of social capital. There is an even greater need to identify the mechanism by which social capital may exert a contextual effect on individual health.  3 potential pathways social capital might influence individual health at neighbourhood level:  influence on health behaviours of residents (through a) diffusion of health information; b) increase likelihood of healthy behaviours being adopted; c) exerting social control over unhealthy behaviours andndash; collective efficacy.. influence health by increasing access to local services and amenities influence individual health through psychosocial process andndash; e.g. provision of affective support, or as source of mutual esteem and self respect.</conclusion>

    <key_issues_rel_he>Mechanisms Social support may protect health by buffering against the effects of life events which may be damaging to health. Also there may be direct effects in promoting sense of control of one's life and self worth. Social support may have physiological effects through the hormonal system, on the body's response to stress and functioning of the immune system. Health outcomes: Social support which reduces social isolation is associated with reduced levels of mortality from cardiovascular disease, accidents, suicide. Better social support is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. People with better social support may cope with illness better and have better prognoses when ill. Better social support is beneficial to mental health; associated with lower levels of anxiety, depression.
